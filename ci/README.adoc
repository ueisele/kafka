= Kafka Docker Build Environment

You can use this Docker images to build Kafka in a specific environment.

The following environments are at the moment supported:

* 11.0.10: JDK 11.0.10
* 11.0.11: JDK 11.0.11
* 11.0.11-tls1.1: JDK 11.0.11 with TLSv1.1
* 11: JDK 11 latest
* 11-tls1.1: JDK 11 latest with TLSv1.1

As of JDK 11.0.11, TLSv1.1 is disabled by default (see https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8256490).
TLSv1.1 can be re-enabled by removing "TLSv1.1" from the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property in the `java.security` configuration file.
This has been done in the environments `11.0.11-tls1.1` and `11-tls1.1`.

In order to build Kafka you need the environments `11.0.10`, `11.0.11-tls1.1` or `11-tls1.1`. As of 11.0.11 tests with TLSv1.1 like `SslTransportLayerTest.testUnsupportedTLSVersion` will fail.

You can run tests:

[source,bash]
----
./ci/do_in_docker 11-tls1.1 ./gradlew clients:unitTest --tests SslTransportLayerTest.testUnsupportedTLSVersion --rerun-tasks
